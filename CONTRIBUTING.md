Please follow these rules when contributing new resources to this repo.

- The resources must be 100% free and available online for everyone.
- The resource must be in English and should provide great value as everyone is trying to sell a course these days and only a few of them are high quality.
- The resource should be aimed at beginners and should be easy to follow through.
- If the resource is a YouTube video then it should be one that teaches throughly and not one of the "Learn X in Y mintues" type.
